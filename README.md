#Titanic Dataset - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

This project is part of my internship task where I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to understand data patterns, trends, and relationships using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

##Objectives

- Generate summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Visualize numeric features using histograms and boxplots
- Analyze feature relationships via pairplots and correlation matrix
- Detect patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset
- Make basic feature-level inferences from visualizations
  
##Dataset

The dataset used is the **Titanic Dataset** which contains information about passengers such as age, sex, class, fare, and survival status.
- File: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`

##Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

##Key Visualizations
- Survival rate by gender and class
- Fare and age distributions
- Correlation heatmap of numeric features
- Outlier detection using boxplots

##Insights & Inferences
- **Females had a much higher survival rate** than males.
- **First-class passengers** were more likely to survive than third-class.
- **High fares correlated** with better survival, indicating economic advantage.
- Several **outliers** detected in fare and age distributions.
- Feature-level analysis helped identify the strongest predictors of survival.

##Result

The EDA provides a clear understanding of how passenger features like sex, age, class, and fare impacted survival, and highlights key trends useful for building predictive models.
